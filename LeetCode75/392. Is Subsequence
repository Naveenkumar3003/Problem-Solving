Problem in Simple Words

You are given two strings: s and t
Check whether all characters of s appear in t in the same order
Characters do not need to be contiguous

Key Idea (Two Pointers)

Use:

sp → pointer for string s
tp → pointer for string t

Move through t and try to match characters of s.

class Solution {
public:
    bool isSubsequence(string s, string t) {
        int sp=0,tp=0;
        while(sp<s.length() && tp<t.length()){
            if(s[sp]==t[tp]) sp++;
            tp++;
        }
        return sp==s.length();
    }
};
