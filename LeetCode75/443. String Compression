Problem in Simple Words

You are given a character array chars.
  You must:
    Compress consecutive repeating characters
    Write the compressed result back into the same array
    Return the new length
    
 ⚠️ You must not use extra space (no new arrays / strings).
 🔑 Key Rules

For each group of same characters:

If count = 1 → write only the character
If count > 1 → write character + digits of count

Example: 12 → '1', '2'

💡 Core Technique: Two Pointers
We use:
read → to scan the array
write → to overwrite the array with compressed result

✅ Optimal Strategy (O(n), O(1) space)
Steps:

Start reading from index 0
Count how many times the current character repeats

Write:

the character
the count (if > 1), digit by digit

Move to next group
